Professional Enhanced Results Viewer â€“ Multi-Tab Support for Analyzing Multiple Opponents
All Classic Features Retained
Includes everything from the Classic version: Summary table, Heatmap, Graphs, and Compare mode.
Multi-Tab Design
Unlike the Classic version, which analyzes a single opponent at a time, the Pro version supports multiple tabs:
In the same hand, view your strategy against multiple positions simultaneously (e.g., BTN vs SB & BB & MP & CO)
Instantly switch between tabs to compare how different opponents respond
Better reflects real in-game scenarios, making reviews and coaching more efficient
