Comprehensive Strategy Insights with Interactive Tables and Multi-Dimensional Views
Interactive Result Display
Gain a clear understanding of strategy details at a glance with fully interactive result visualization.
Summary Table & View Switching
A Display dropdown menu above the Summary table allows you to seamlessly switch between different data dimensions:
Strategy: Optimal strategy distribution
Strategy + EQ / EV / EQR: Overlay equity, expected value (EV), or equilibrium ratio (EQR) on top of strategy
Weight / EQ / EV / EQR: Independently view hand weight, equity, expected value, or equilibrium ratio


This integrated design lets you explore multiple analytical perspectives within the same table, eliminating the need to switch views elsewhere.
Comprehensive Data Overview
For each hand, the table provides:
Strategy distribution
Hand weight
Equity (EQ)
Expected value (EV)
Equilibrium ratio (EQR)


A Total row is also included, making it easy to compare overall OOP vs. IP performance at a glance.
Debugging & Decision Paths
Debug: Quickly identify unusual strategies or specific nodes
Decision Path: Trace the full sequence of actions to understand the logic behind every decision.
 Note: Decision Path displays JSON-format decision data only. If you want to save or share solver configurations or solver results, you still need to use File Operations to export them as JSON or BIN files.
